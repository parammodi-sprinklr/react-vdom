## Build a Virtual DOM Reconciliation System
## Scenario:
You are tasked with implementing a simple Virtual DOM system in React, where elements are represented as plain JavaScript objects, and the application should update the real DOM efficiently when the virtual DOM changes. You must create a lightweight version of Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm, where you manage the updates to the real DOM when there are changes in the virtual DOM.

## Requirements:
- **Virtual DOM Representation**:

  Implement a function createElement that represents a DOM node as a JavaScript object. This object should contain the type, props, and children of the DOM node.

- **DOM Diffing Algorithm**:

  Implement a diff function that compares two virtual DOM trees and returns the differences between them.
  Implement an updateDOM function that applies the necessary changes to the real DOM based on the diff.

- **Rendering Logic**:

  Implement a render function that takes a virtual DOM tree and renders it into the actual DOM.

- **User Interaction**:

  Create an example component that interacts with the virtual DOM, such as a counter that updates based on user input, to demonstrate the virtual DOM reconciliation.

## Expected Features:
- **createElement(type, props, children)**:

  This function should return a JavaScript object representation of a DOM node.

- **diff(oldVNode, newVNode)**:

  This function compares the old virtual DOM node with the new virtual DOM node and returns the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM.

- **updateDOM(parent, patches)**:

  This function takes the DOM element (parent) and applies the changes (patches) generated by the diff algorithm to the real DOM.

- **render(vNode, container)**:

  This function renders the virtual DOM node into a real DOM container
